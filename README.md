# Building--a--Support--Agent--Chatbot--for--CDP

# Flask Web Application
This is a simple Flask web application that serves an HTML file and handles static files like CSS and JavaScript. The app is structured to provide a basic demonstration of serving HTML pages with Flask.

# Project Overview
This project is a chatbot that helps users find answers to "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation of these platforms and provides the user with step-by-step guidance.

Features
Answer "How-to" Questions: The chatbot can respond to user queries about how to perform tasks in Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.
Extract Information from Documentation: The chatbot can navigate through the official documentation of each platform and extract relevant instructions.
Handle Variations in Questions: The chatbot handles variations in phrasing and terminology.
